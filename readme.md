# About

The purpose of this work is to link Open Educational Resources (OER) with Digital Competences (CD) represented in the DigComp Framework. The diversity of repositories OER increases every day, which generates some difficulty when it comes to finding the right resource, it is this same variety that becomes detrimental since not all repositories manage to reach popularity due to the existing search algorithms. On the other hand, the DigComp Framework limits the extraction / interaction with useful information due to the way its content is presented, only in natural language. Thus, it was decided to use technologies of the Semantic Web such as the representation of knowledge, ontologies for both CD and OER. In such a way that the OER can be integrated under the same scheme and also allowing search processes that contribute to each of the CD. All this is implemented in a Web application that allows interaction with the information collected.

**Keywords:** Knowledge Graph, DigComp, REA.
